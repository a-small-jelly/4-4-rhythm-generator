# 4-4-rhythm-generator

Whether due to ADHD or some other neurodivergent trait (or combination of them), when I feel creative, instead of a sudden burst of flowing expressive energy, it feels like an ever-expanding force trapped behind a wall. Generally I can access this by collaboration, talking through ideas, playing music with others, etc, but due to pandemic-induced isolation, I haven't been able to do this. I pull out pens and paper, sit at a drum kit or keyboard, open my computer, drag out stencils or linocut materials, but feel paralyzed and unable to begin anything. When I'm creating a town for a D&D campaign and need a name, I'll usually head to an online name generator, or a list of city/town names from a certain area or period of history, and reading those suggestions tends to let my own ideas flow out from behind the wall. I made this tool to do something similar with music -- often when I pull out an instrument, it's really hard to just get started, even if I have an idea I can hear in my head.

This super basic rhythm generator is in 4/4, gives four measures of random 16th note rhythm, and for each beat, a corresponding note marked 1-8, to apply to the key signature of your choice.
