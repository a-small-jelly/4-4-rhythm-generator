# 4-4-rhythm-generator

whether due to adhd or some other neurodivergent trait (or combination of them), when i feel creative, instead of a sudden burst of flowing expressive energy, it feels like an ever-expanding force trapped behind a wall. generally i can access this by collaboration, talking through ideas, playing music with others, etc, but due to pandemic-induced isolation, i haven't been able to do this. i pull out pens and paper, sit at a drum kit or keyboard, open my computer, drag out stencils or linocut materials, but feel paralyzed and unable to begin anything. when i'm creating a town for a d&d campaign and need a name, i'll usually head to an online name generator, or a list of city/town names from a certain area or period of history, and reading those suggestions tends to let my own ideas flow out from behind the wall. i made this tool to do something similar with music -- often when i pull out an instrument, it's really hard to just get started, even if i have an idea i can hear in my head.

this super basic rhythm generator is in 4/4, gives four measures of random 16th note rhythm, and for each beat, a corresponding note marked 1-8, to apply to the key signature of your choice.
